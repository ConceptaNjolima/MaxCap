## App's purpose
 As we all adjust to this new way of life post COVID, we wanted to create an app that will ensure people stay safe when they leave the comfort of their homes. 

## App Description

With Covid-19 restrictions getting lifted in many states, different businesses are opening but with limited capacity and new restrictions. Inspired by this change, we wanted to create something that would help people adjust while staying safe and following the law.
Short Description: What is your app trying to accomplish?
Max Cap is a mobile phone application that will help users know the current and maximum capacity of customers a business can accept, know the latest Covid-19 regulations in the region the business is in and to request reservations at businesses that allow it.
What technical/coding difficulty did you face in programming your app, and how did you address this technical challenge

## Difficulties we encountered were:

- Learning and setting up the environment for React posed some difficulty, but we took advantage of online sources, like YouTube, that demonstrated and explained solutions to this problem.
- We werenâ€™t able to implement the search functionality in the demonstration, but we successfully completed the UI and Navigation of the search page to enable full demonstration. 
- We ran into some bugs while we were working on connecting the different pages by routing and using stacks, however we were able to get it to work after taking a closer look at the react navigation documentation and some Youtube tutorials. 
- We ran into some difficulty connecting our app to an API (applying for credits for the Google Maps Covid-19 API and the Yelp restaurant API), we addressed this by creating our own static database that enabled us to run our app.
